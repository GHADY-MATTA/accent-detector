Transcript:
 Section engineer Sanjay Kumar makes use of a special inspection trolley to reach the  remoteest stretches of track.  To maintain that track, it is less tail engine than to reach near that track.  So to go up to that time, so much energy you will lose, that you require minimum one hour  to recover.  This job is challenging.  Here, you have to become expert to take fit decision.  This job is good for young person.  How to 40 year old?  This job is good there.  On the clock.  Whenever this natural calamity is coming, we have to clear that text.  Every time, under cyclonic rain, that track is coming under the problem of natural calamity.  Suddenly, some bridge build collapse, you have a challenging task.  It is some tough, but you have to keep your mind alert.  You are keeping your mind alert, then good there.  And your luck should favor to you.  Enjoyment is there.  Proud.  Proud also can fill yes.  When people are asking where are you working, then I am telling that I am seeing engineering  section of pilgrimage in Montendelway.  That's even that time I am feeling proudness.  Each morning is uniqueness.  Their plan is not like that.  Two and a half kilometers till I took them.  Probably 12 to 13 minutes.  Well done.  Proud also.  We are doing first testing.  We are doing first blasting.  Blasting is a successful BSL pass in the train.  Yes.  It is nothing.  This...  Very nice.  What do we have now?  What do we have now?  Not only 10 meter cutting height that boulder can come,  National highway half also can cut.  But it will become dangerous sir.  One big country new rain was there.  So wooden slipper sinking down.  We are working from last one hour.  At least we are not able to clear it.  We are not able to push this boulder technically with the help of crowbars.  This would come away from this track.  It is dangerous place where we are at.  This.
