Accent: American (Confidence: 95%)
Summary: The speaker uses American English pronunciation and colloquialisms, such as "get it seen and get it shared" and the specific rhythm and intonation patterns common in American speech.

 Wow, what an audience. But if I'm being honest, I don't care what you think of my talk.  I don't. I care what the internet thinks of my talk. Because they're the ones who get it seen and get it shared.  And I think that's where most people get it wrong. They're talking to you here.  Instead of talking to you, random person scrolling Facebook, thanks for the click.  You see, back in 2009, we all had these weird little things called attention spans.  Yeah, they're gone. They're gone. We killed them. They're dead.  I'm trying to think of the last time I watched an 18-minute TED talk. It's been years, literally years.  So if you're giving a TED talk, keep it quick. I'm doing mine in under a minute.  I'm at 44 seconds right now. That means we've got time for one final joke.  Why are balloons so expensive? Inflation.

Accent: Indian (Confidence: 95%)
Summary: The speaker's accent is classified as Indian due to the pronunciation of certain words (e.g., 'sinness' for 'stillness'), intonation patterns, and the inclusion of the greeting 'salam alaikum', which are indicative of Indian English.
Transcript:
 Hello everybody, salam alaikum, my name is Talal and today I'll be talking about the  power of sinness.  Imagine a river moving incredibly fast.  It collides with rocks, twists and bends and carries everything in its path.  But once you step into the water where it's still, you can see straight to the bottom.  You notice the pebbles, the way sunlight dances on the surface, the quiet world beneath.  In a world that never stops moving, what if the most powerful thing we could do is pause?  The modern world is noisy, the clatter of keyboards, the hum of traffic, the relentless pressure  to keep going, to keep achieving, to keep proving.  We are conditioned to believe that success is measured by movement, that at the faster  we go, the further we'll get.  But in our pursuit of progress, we really ask, what happens if we stop?  We fear sinness, we call it laziness, compliance, weakness, we avoid silence because it makes  us uncomfortable.  But I'm here to tell you, sinness is not emptiness, it's a source of power.  The science behind sinness studies show that moments of sinness through meditation, deep  breathing or just simply sitting in silence, to get the prefrontal cortex, the part of our  brain responsible for creativity, clarity and decision-making.  It also lowers cortisol, the stress hormone and increases serotonin, the happiness chemical.  Even athletes understand this, between explosive moments of action, there are strategic pauses.  There are strategic pauses, breaths that recalibrate focus.  And in those brief moments, the body aligns, the brain sharpens and clarity emerges.  Many leaders like Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr. understood the power of sinness, they  seek solitude before making world-changing decisions.  Philosophers like Lao Zhu taught that true wisdom arises when we quiet the mind.  The natural world teaches us the same lesson.  The mighty is trees do not grow through constant movement.  Instead, they stand still, they absorb energy, they absorb sunlight before reaching skyward.  Oceans appear calm on the surface, but beneath the sinness, ecosystems flourish.  Sinness is not stagnation, it's preparation.  So you see, sinness isn't about just being like in a quiet room doing nothing.  It's about seeing details, we miss the softness of a sunrise, the unspoken emotions in a  loved one's eyes, and the weight of unprocessed thoughts and truths that we've buried beneath  distractions.  So how do we embrace sinness?  First of all, we can start small, you can take one deep breath before your next conversation  or you can seek solitude, even five minutes of quiet can shift your perspective of you.  This connect, give yourself permission to step away from screens, notifications, and  the urge to be constantly reachable.  Listen to silence, not just the absence of sounds, but the presence of awareness.  I challenge you today, find one pause in your routine, one quiet place where you can  just sit alone and think about yourself.  Think about the things that you thought about before when you were a child, and maybe  a long lost dream, peace or clarity.  So you see, sinness gives us a lot of things, it helps us with being more wise, being  more intelligent, and we have peace.  Thank you all.

Transcript:
 When I was 27 years old, I left a very demanding job in management consulting.  For a job that was even more demanding, teaching, I went to teach seventh graders math in the  New York City public schools. And like any teacher I made quizzes and tests, I gave out homework  assignments. When the work came back, I calculated grades. What struck me was that IQ was not the only  difference between my best and my worst students. Some of my strongest performers did not have  stratospheric IQ scores. Some of my smartest kids weren't doing so well. And that got me thinking  things. The kinds of things you need to learn in seventh grade math, sure they're hard, ratios,  decimals, the area of a parallelogram. But these concepts are not impossible. And I was firmly  convinced that every one of my students could learn the material if they worked hard and long  enough. After several more years of teaching, I came to the conclusion that what we need in  education is a much better understanding of students and learning from a motivational perspective,  from a psychological perspective. In education, the one thing we know how to measure best is IQ. But  what if doing well in school and in life depends on much more than your ability to learn quickly and  easily. So I left the classroom and I went to graduate school to become a psychologist. I started  studying kids and adults in all kinds of super challenging settings. And in every study my question  was, who is successful here and why? My research team and I went to West Point Military Academy.  We tried to predict which cadets would stay in military training and which would drop out. We  went to the National Spelling V and tried to predict which children would advance farthest in competition.  We studied rookie teachers working in really tough neighborhoods asking which teachers are still  going to be here in teaching by the end of the school year and of those who will be the most  effective at improving learning outcomes for their students. We partnered with private companies  asking which of these salespeople is going to keep their jobs and who's going to earn the most  money. In all those very different contexts, one characteristic emerged as a significant predictor  of success. And it wasn't social intelligence, it wasn't good looks, physical health, and it  wasn't IQ. It was grit. Grit is passion and perseverance for very long term goals. Grit is  having stamina. Grit is sticking with your future. Day in, day out, not just for the week,  not just for the month, but for years, and working really hard to make that future a reality.  Grit is living life like it's a marathon, not a sprint. A few years ago, I started studying grit  in the Chicago public schools. I asked thousands of high school juniors to take grit questionnaires.  And then waited around more than a year to see who would graduate. Turns out that grittier kids  were significantly more likely to graduate. Even when I matched them on every characteristic I  could measure, things like family income, standardized achievement test scores, even how safe kids felt  when they were at school. So it's not just that West Point or the national spelling bee that  grit matters, it's also in school, especially for kids at risk for dropping out.  To me, the most shocking thing about grit is how little we know, how little science knows about  building it. Every day parents and teachers ask me, how do I build grit in kids? What do I do to  teach kids a solid work ethic? How do I keep them motivated for the long run? The honest answer is,  I don't know. What I do know is that talent doesn't make you gritty. Our data show very clearly  that there are many talented individuals who simply do not follow through on their commitments.  In fact, in our data, grit is usually unrelated or even inversely related to measures of talent.  So far, the best idea I've heard about building grit in kids is something called growth mindset.  This is an idea developed at Stanford University by Carol Dweck, and it is the belief that the  ability to learn is not fixed, that it can change with your effort. Dr. Dweck has shown that when  kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grows in response to challenge,  they're much more likely to persevere when they fail because they don't believe that failure  is a permanent condition. So growth mindset is a great idea for building grit,  but we need more. And that's where I'm going to end my remarks because that's where we are.  That's the work that stands before us. We need to take our best ideas, our strongest intuitions,  and we need to test them. We need to measure whether we've been successful and we have to be  willing to fail, to be wrong, to start over again with lessons learned. In other words,  we need to be gritty about getting our kids grittier. Thank you.
