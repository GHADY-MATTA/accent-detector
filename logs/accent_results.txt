Accent: American (Confidence: 95%)
Summary: The speaker uses American English pronunciation and colloquialisms, such as "get it seen and get it shared" and the specific rhythm and intonation patterns common in American speech.
Transcript:
 Wow, what an audience. But if I'm being honest, I don't care what you think of my talk.  I don't. I care what the internet thinks of my talk.
